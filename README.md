# Saccharomyces cerevisiae bulk RNA seq analysis
A workflow outlining the steps to analyze bulk transcriptomic data on Saccharomyces cerevisiae

## Introduction
*Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)*, also known as brewer’s yeast, plays an important role in manufacturing alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. In the context of sherry wine, flor yeast is a specialized type of *S. cerevisiae* that forms biofilms/velum on the surface of wine during the winemaking process. There are three biofilm stages: the early stage where it is characterized by the initial yeast attachment and adaptation, the thin stage where yeast cells are metabolically changing, and the mature stage define by a stable oxidative biofilm structure (Mardanov et al., 2020). Whereas most yeast strains are used for alcoholic fermentation, flor yeast is instead used to biologically age sherry wines. Therefore, flor yeast must adapt to use alternative modes of carbon and nitrogen metabolism to withstand the stressful environment where acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations are high (Alexandre, 2013). In fact, ethanol and glycerol becomes the primary source of carbon. Characterizing these stage transitions with transcriptomics would provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie flor yeast metabolism and survival. In fact, *S. cerevisiae* is a widely used and well-characterized model organism. It was the first eukaryotic model organism where RNA-sequencing has been employed (Nagalakshmi et al., 2008). Despite the advancements of RNA-sequencing technologies, analysis is required to fully understand the transcriptome of flor yeast. 

In fact, many computational tools have been developed to analyze RNA-seq datasets. Therefore, it is important to know the inherit advantages and disadvantages of each tool. Historically, trimming has been included as a preprocessing step in many standard RNA-seq pipelines. However, recent studies have reported that trimming is not necessarily required prior to gene counts due to many reasons. Firstly, a study reported that aggressive trimming with several trimming tools such as Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) in Drosophila melanogaster RNA-seq data reported significant variations of over ten percent in gene expression (Williams et al., 2016). In fact, over trimming may result in improper alignment of reads to the reference genome or transcriptome. In addition, it has been reported that untrimmed reads perform similarly or slightly better than trimmed reads (Liao & Shi, 2020). Therefore, trimming will not be utilized prior to processing gene counts. In fact, trimming may not be required if splice aware alignments are employed or if the quality of the reads is ideal.

If novel isoforms of genes transcripts are being studied, splice aware programs such as STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) (Dobin et al., 2013) and HISAT2 (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2) can be employed. In addition, it has been reported that splicing does occur in yeast however, its function is limited compared to higher order eukaryotic organisms and mainly results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Kawashima et al., 2014). Minimap2 is also another option however, it has been suggested to be more suited to long-read sequencing data such as Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences Illumina (Patro et al., 2017). In contrast, if gene expression analysis is the main goal, pseudo-aligning programs such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) can be used instead. The advantage of Salmon and Kallisto over STAR and HISAT2 is that they are computationally faster due to aligning to the transcriptome instead of aligning base to base to the reference genome. However, a disadvantage of alignment-free methods when compared to alignment-based methods is quantifying small RNAs such as tRNAs. In fact, there was a higher tRNA root mean square error (>0.4) for Kallisto and Salmon compared to alignment-based methods (<0.25) such as HISAT2 (Wu et al., 2018). When comparing both pseudo-alignment methods, Salmon has been reported to be more accurate than Kallisto due to the program’s inherit GC and sequencing bias detection which improves the accuracy and robustness of quantification (Patro et al., 2017). In fact, bias is an important aspect that needs to be considered when performing RNA-sequencing analysis since bias affects downstream analysis in the form of noise. Therefore, Salmon will be employed because of its accuracy, the main goal is to perform gene expression analysis in *S. cerevisiae*, and due to the limited splicing that occur in yeast.

Many packages are available in RStudio to perform downstream gene expression analysis and choosing which one to employ depends on the biological question, the type of data, and experimental design. For example, DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) and edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) are two commonly used programs to analyze RNA-seq data. Both tools use a negative binomial distribution model that generally perform well on 2 group pairwise comparison to maximize power. In fact, DESeq2 is commonly used for pairwise comparison analysis (Spies et al., 2019). Alternatively, limma is another RNA-seq package that uses linear models to analyze RNA-seq data (Ritchie et al., 2015). In fact, limma excels at time course-based experiments and more complex experimental designs. However, a study shows that short time course series which was defined as less than 8 timepoints, performed worse when time-course methods were used when compared to pairwise comparisons. In fact, DESeq2 which was used as the pairwise condition, exhibited 1014 true positives (TP), 70 false positives (FP), and a F1 score of 0.89 while most of the other time-course methods has worse summary statistics except for ImpulseDE2 (Spies et al., 2019). While both use robust normalization methods, with DESeq2 using median of ratios, and edgeR using trimmed mean of M-values, DESeq2 has been reported to perform slightly better than edgeR when sample sizes that are smaller than 10 (n < 10) due to its more conservative estimates resulting in lower false positives (Thawng & Smith, 2023). In fact, the median of ratios method assumes that not all genes are differentially expressed and is robust enough to detect if there are significant changes even when the data has much more upregulated genes than downregulated or vice-versa. Since this analysis will have a total of nine samples, with a total of 3 timepoints which is defined as a short time-course series, and were sampled randomly, DESeq2 will be employed to reduce the chance of FP discoveries and increase TP discoveries. While DESeq2 uses an adaptive Normally distributed prior to shrink the effect size of log fold changes (LFC), it has been reported that this method can over-shrink true positives of large LFCs or genes with adequate signal can be lost. Therefore, the Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model (apeglm) (Zhu et al., 2019), will be used. This method uses heavy tail priors while still preserving large effects, shrinkis noise from small estimates, and reduces high variance in LFC values.

The overall goal is to perform comparative transcriptomic analysis of a *S. cerevisiae* flor strain, I-329. Specifically, this analysis aims to characterize stage-specific transcriptional and functional pathway changes across early, thin, and mature biofilms to understand metabolic and stress-related pathways during sherry-like wine manufacturing. The analysis will be done by pairwise comparisons. Consequently, this allows for the counting and cataloguing of mRNA transcripts, and to characterize gene expression under different biofilm stages. In addition, this allows for a full and comprehensive transcriptomic analysis that includes differential gene expression (DEGs) and gene ontology (GO) analysis. 

## Methodology
#### Obtaining Transcriptome Data and Quality Control
RNA-sequencing data were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) using the accession numbers SRR10551657 - SRR10551665. The download files and Salmon analysis bash script code was adapted from the tutorial (https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/getting_started/). Briefly, the samples were previously sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and generated 6 to 9 million reads that were 50bp in length for each sample (Mardanov et al., 2020). The samples represent three different stages/groups of yeast biofilm formation: early biofilm, thin biofilm, and mature biofilm; with each group having a total of 3 replicates (Table 1). The *S. cerevisiae* strain S288C reference transcriptome file was downloaded from the NCBI’s database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000146045.2/). The S288C strain was used because its genes are well-annotated, well-maintained, and has the most complete assembly out of all strains which will allow for robust downstream gene expression analysis (Engel et al., 2014). Packages such as FastQC, MultiQC, and Salmon were downloaded via Bioconda (Grüning et al., 2018) on Bash terminal. Accurate and quick quality control is a major critical step to determine the quality of the RNA-sequencing reads. Therefore, FastQC v0.12.1 (Andrews, 2010) was employed to check the quality of the sequencing reads. Salmon v1.10.3 (Patro et al., 2017) was utilized to quantify the number of reads with the “-l A flag” for automatic detection of library type and the “--gcbias” flag as recommended by DESeq2’s vignette (Love et al., 2014). To check the quality of the quantification results from Salmon, MultiQC v1.33 (Ewels et al., 2016) was used to quickly assess important summary statistics such as percent of mapped reads and number of mapped reads. Quality control plots from MultiQC and FastQC were visualized using ggplot2 v4.0.2 (Wickham, 2009) in RStudio v4.5.1 (2025-06-13). 

#### Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Gene quantifications were imported intro RStudio. DESeq2 v1.50.2 (Love et al., 2014) package was employed for normalization by the medians of ratios method using the DEseq() function, and the default Wald test to obtain comparable gene expression levels between samples. Three pairwise comparisons were examined using the DESeqDataSet generated using the design formula ~stage to to compare early to thin, thin to mature, and early to mature stages. Therefore, apeglm v1.32.0 (Zhu et al., 2019) package was employed to increase the accuracy of LFC estimates that have low counts or high variability. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the data structure of each sample. The top 20 DEGs were filtered for adjusted p-value (padj) <0.05 and the absolute values of LFC of each gene in all three corresponding pairwise comparison were extracted. Independent scaling was done for each comparison. Key results include volcano plots for DEGs, PCA plot for data structure, and heatmap for the top 20 DEGs. 

#### GSEA and KEGG Analysis
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using annotations from the *S. cerevisiae* genome database (https://www.yeastgenome.org/) . Statistical analyses of GSEA were conducted with clusterProfiler v4.18.4 (Yu et al., 2012), with the application of Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control for false discovery rates (FDR), a padj cutoff of < 0.05, and fast gene set enrichment analysis (fgsea) (Korotkevich et al., 2019) method to identify enriched and significant pathways. GSEA analysis and plotting code were adapted from the tutorials available online (https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/rna-seq-analysis/gene-set-enrichment-analysis/) and (https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/enrichplot.html). While Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) is a common method for gene analysis, GSEA is more powerful and robust because it considers all ranked distribution of genes rather than ORA’s method of using only top DEGs. GO annotations were retrieved from the genome wide yeast database using the org.Sc.gsd.db package within clusterProfiler, with a focus on biological process (BP) ontology. clusterProfiler’s simplify() function was applied to remove redundant GO terms. For GSEA, genes were ranked according to the log2foldchange values obtained from DESeq2 and sorted in descending order. To complement GO-based enrichment analysis, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment was employed with the “enrichKEGG” function, with parameters organism = “sce” for *S.cerevisiae* to assess metabolic and signalling pathways. Key results were plotted as GSEA enrichment plots and KEGG dot plots.

All analysis scripts, including quality control, Salmon quantification, and R Studio code for gene expression and enrichment analysis is available at https://github.com/liona-vu/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_bulk_RNA_seq_analysis.

#### Quality check of RNA-seq data reveals sufficient quality 
FastQC quality control revealed that RNA-seq data was of high quality. Specifically, no reads were flagged as poor quality, GC content ranged from 41% - 45% which is slightly higher than the average of 38.3% (Wood et al., 2002), and base sequence Phred scores were 30 (Table 2). Therefore, no trimming was required, and no samples were excluded from the analysis. Quality control summary statistics by MultiQC after Salmon quantification indicate all mapping rate percentages were greater than 80% for samples except for SRR10551660 and SRR10551661 which ranged around 74 – 76%, indicating a generally acceptable mapping rate Fig. 1A). A mapping rate of less than 50% would be concerning as it may indicate sample contamination, poor ribosomal RNA depletion, or problems with data processing (Dobin & Gingeras, 2015). In addition, Fig. 1B show the mapped reads which were in the millions for all samples. Overall, summary statistics show that the RNA-sequencing and mapping reads were ideal and acceptable for gene expression analysis.

#### Differentially expressed genes observed for all three stage comparisons
Using an adjusted p-value of < 0.05 and absolute value of LFC > 1, 496 upregulated genes and 450 downregulated genes were identified in the early to thin comparison, 641 upregulated genes and 472 downregulated genes were identified in the thin to mature comparison, and 954 upregulated genes and 778 downregulated genes were identified in the early to mature comparison (Table 3). Volcano plots also visually indicate that there are many significant genes that are either upregulated or downregulated across all three pairwise comparisons (Fig. 2A-C). 

<br>

<img width="722" height="116" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-01 at 11 49 57 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58ee5340-4563-4287-94df-b73d330145a7" />

**Table 3. Summary table of DEGs across all 3 stage comparisons.** Comparisons between biofilm stages where the following the padj value cutoff and the lof2FoldChange (LFC) are applied.

**Figure 2. Volcano plots for DEGs in all three pairwise comparison of biofilm development.** Each plot represents A. early to thin, B. thin to mature, and C. early to mature. Red signifies DEGs that are upregulated, blue signifies DEGs that are downregulated, and grey signifies non-significant genes. DEGs were defined as significant if P-value is < 0.05, and absolute value of LFC is >1. 

<br>

#### Certain genes have altered expression in specific stage comparisons
The top 20 significant genes were extracted after apeglm LFC shrinkage for each stage transition (Fig. 3A-C). It is important to note that since each heatmap is scaled independently, relative gene expression is only comparable within that specific comparison only and not throughout all 3 heatmaps. FIT3 (Facilitator of iron transport 3) and PHR1 (Photoreactivation repair deficient 1) were upregulated in early samples relative to thin samples (Fig. 3A). In fact, FIT3 is a mannoprotein protein that helps with iron homeostasis and uptake in the yeast cell wall (Protchenko et al., 2001) while PHR1 responds to DNA damage (Sebastian & Sancar, 1991). ADH7 (Alcohol dehydrogenase 7), and DAK2 (Dihydroxyacetone kinase 2), genes that reduces and detoxifies aldehydes and detoxification of dihydroxyacetone, respectively, were highly expressed in thin samples compared to mature samples. REE1 (Regulation of enolase) is lowly expressed in the thin stage compared to mature (Fig. 3B) but is highly expressed in mature samples compared to early samples (Fig. 3C) which was also consistent with literature findings (Mardanov et al., 2020). Finally, AIF1 (Apoptosis-Inducing Factor 1) and HXT13 (hexose transporter 13) is highly expressed in mature samples compared to early (Fig. 3C). Overall, earlier samples were enriched in stress and iron homeostasis, thin stage showed increase expression in detoxification of intermediate metabolites, and mature stages show increased mitochondrial and alternative carbon metabolism.

**Figure 3. Heatmap of top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between all three pairwise comparisons of each biofilm developmental stage.** Each heatmap represents DEGs identified between A. early to thin, B. thin to mature, and C. early to mature stages. Rows represent genes that had the most significant LFC, had variance stabilizing transformation applied, and is scaled by row to highlight expression patterns. Colours on scales indicate that yellow represents higher expression and purple indicates lower expression. Columns represent individual biological replicates (n=3) and is marked by colour for each stage. Hierarchal clustering by biofilm stages on the columns is observed. 

<br>

#### PCA and heatmap shows clustering of yeast samples by biofilm stages
Hierarchal clustering of the top 20 DEGs show that for each pairwise comparison, all biological replicates grouped by biofilm stages and indicates stage-specific expression (Fig. 3A-C). To fully determine the structure of the dataset, the dimensional reduction technique, PCA was applied to all 9 flor yeast samples, revealing 3 distinct clusters corresponding to different biofilm stages: early, thin, and mature (Fig. 4). PC1 and PC2 explain 66% and 24% of variance, respectively. In fact, the PCA plot clustering by biofilm stages is in accordance with the grouping in Fig. 3A-C. In summary, each biofilm developmental stage shows stage-specific gene expression with clustering observed.

Each point is labeled with its accession number. Principal component (PC) PC1 and PC2 explain 66% and 24% of variance, respectively. 

<br>

#### GO biological processes and pathways are relevant to biofilm formation
GSEA was employed for all 3 pairwise comparisons. cytoplasmic translation was determined to be one of the first gene set name in the early to thin biofilm transition between ORA and GSEA (Fig. 6A). Energy reserve metabolic process was identified as the top pathway which is consistent with the ORA (Fig. 6B). Finally, mitochondrion organization was identified as the one of the pathways during the early to mature transition (Fig. 6C). 

Finally, KEGG analysis was conducted to determine relevant pathways for each biofilm stage. With a p-value cutoff of 0.05, 27, 21, and 29 significant pathways are observed in the early to thin transition, thin to mature, and early to mature comparisons, respectively. In fact, the early to thin stage show upregulated KEGG pathways in ribosome, and upregulated and downregulation of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Fig. 6A). The thin to mature comparison has upregulated starch and sucrose metabolism (Fig. 6B). Lastly, the early to mature comparison has pathways involved in the mitochondria such as citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 6C).

## Discussion

#### Differentially Expressed Genes are Related to Biofilm Processes
The analysis here provides a detailed analysis of the transcriptional landscape at different stages of flor yeast biofilm formation during sherry wine manufacturing. These stages represent the transition from flocculent yeast growth to a mature and specialized biofilm. During the early-to-thin transition, PHR1 was identified as significantly upregulated in early samples compared to thin samples during the early to thin transition (Fig. 3A). In fact, increased expression of PHR1 indicates that DNA repair mechanism is required suggesting that flor yeast cells are under environmental stress that is caused by encountering environments with high ethanol content and aldehydes. Consistent with the current knowledge, yeast cells are most likely stressed when they are adapting to a new environment during early biofilm formation especially and changing from flocculent or free-floating structure to a structured biofilm (Verstrepen & Klis, 2006). Iron homeostasis also seemed to be altered during the early biofilm development. While FIT3 was identified in this analysis but not reported by (Mardanov et al., 2020), other iron related genes such as FTR1 and FET3 were highly expressed at the thin biofilm stage, suggesting a form of agreement that iron homeostasis is altered during the initial cell adhesion and attachment stage (Mardanov et al., 2020). In fact, ISU1, a gene involved in iron homeostasis during fermentation stress response (Marks et al., 2008), has been reported to respond to fermentation-associated stress conditions. Collectively, these findings suggests that iron homeostasis is altered when yeast cells encounter stressful conditions.

The ability of organisms to adapt to its changing environment is necessary for its survival. As the biofilm progresses to the thin to mature stage, the transcriptional landscape transitions from stress related responses to changes in metabolism. Elevated expression of DAK2 and ADH7 in the thin stage compared to the mature stage (Fig. 3B) suggests that flor yeast cells are undergoing a metabolic transition stage. In fact, DAK2 converts dihydroxyacetone to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and ADH7 converts aldehydes to alcohols. As flor yeast biofilm stages progresses, there is a build-up of toxic substances such as dihydroxyacetone and aldehydes. In fact, this pattern was consistent with the sample metadata where there is an increase of aldehydes (mg/l) across biofilm stages; 382.8 (early), 531.3 (thin), and 668.8 (mature) (Mardanov et al., 2020). In fact, the upregulation of ADH7 is noteworthy given that there is evidence suggesting that  its mRNA is abundant in yeast in the presence of vanillin, an example of an aldehyde (Ishida et al., 2017). These results suggests that the thin to mature transition represents flor yeast cells shifting their metabolic phase to detoxify aldehydes and dihydroxyacetone.
Interestingly, AIF1 and HXT13 was determined to be expressed in mature samples compared to early (Fig. 3C). AIF1 is a key regulator of mitochondrial-associated cell death in mammalian cells where it is initially found in the mitochondria before translocating to the nucleus in the presence of apoptotic signals (Wissing et al., 2004). Increased AIF1 expression during the mature stage is consistent with current literature evidence that mitochondrial and oxidative stress genes are activated under mature flor biofilm stage (Mardanov et al., 2020). In addition, a proteome study has report similar findings where there were significant changes in mitochondria proteins during flor yeast velum formation (Moreno-García et al., 2017). HXT13, a hexose transporter, has been reported to be upregulated in S. cerevisiae in the presence of non-fermentable sources such as glycerol and ethanol (Greatrix & van Vuuren, 2006). Together, these findings indicate mature flor yeast biofilms must adapt to the harsh conditions and adapt other metabolic methods to obtain carbon sources. 

#### GSEA and KEGG Analysis 
Moving forward with biological program analysis, GSEA is a powerful computational analysis tool used to understand the biological processes of yeast biofilm formation when complemented with KEGG analysis. In fact, these approaches also align with previous individual gene specific findings. The early to thin transition GSEA pathways such as ribosomal biogenesis and translation aligns with KEGG terms such as ribosome and biosynthesis of amino acids (Fig 5A, 6A). This supports the finding that early biofilm development involves protein synthesis. Interestingly, biosynthesis of amino acids had both upregulated and downregulated clusters, suggesting a highly dynamic process where certain genes are starting to be downregulated such as fermentable carbon-based metabolism and genes for biofilm adhesion are beginning to be upregulated. 
The thin to mature transition also has alignment of GSEA and KEGG terms of glycogen biosynthesis process and starch and sucrose metabolism, respectively. This is in line with current knowledge that flor yeast cells adapt its metabolic process to storing carbon. Finally, the early to mature analysis GSEA mitochondrion organization and KEGG citrate cycle (TCA cycle) are in accordance with each other. This aligns with previous findings such as AIF1, where the mitochondria is altered during the mature stage in addition to evidence in literature where they found significantly upregulated mitochondrial-related GO terms  (Mardanov et al., 2020)

#### Caveats and Follow-Up Studies
Despite being one of the most well-studied model organisms, several DEGs had uncharacterized or unknown functions in the yeast genome database (Cherry et al., 2012). For example, YHR052C-B was identified as top DEG in Fig. 3C, but proteomics studies have identified it as a novel open reading frame protein (He et al., 2018). Therefore, this highlights the need for a complete database to perform a robust and complete analysis to gain a full understanding of flor yeast biofilm development.
Follow-up is required to validate the differentially expressed genes. For example, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) should be applied to the top identified DEGs for each biofilm stage. A caveat for transcriptomic analysis is that the findings does not necessarily correlate at the protein level. For example, RNA can be quickly degraded once it travels to the cytoplasm. Therefore, multiomics approaches that includes but is not limited to transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics should be considered to increase the robustness of the findings and to have a complete picture of the transitions between different biofilm formations during wine manufacturing.
In summary, important genes, and pathways related to biofilm development in flor yeast have been unveiled.
